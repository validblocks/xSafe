# 🛡️ xSafe Multisig UI

This is the source code of the xSafe Multisig UI for the Multisig SC developed by the MultiversX team.

xSafe is the first Multisig UI developed with the goal of bringing the benefits of a multisig wallet into the hands of everyone!
We've tried to make it easy to use and self-explanatory, but we're also working on setting up the help section.


## ⚙️⛓️ Features

- Open Source UI, based on the audited Multisig smart contract built by the MultiversX team.
- Deploy the official Multisig smart contract directly from the UI.
- Load an existing Multisig smart contract.
- Manage $EGLD, ESDTs, and NFTs (with more to come).
- Interact with other smart contracts directly from the xSafe interface, by using APPS. Anyone can contribute with new APPS since the code is open source.
- The first app already available is "Staking".
- Add/Remove xSafe members (through proposals).
- View pending and past transactions in a clear manner.


## 👥 Contributing

At Valid Blocks, we have worked hard to bring the first version of xSafe to the community. 
The project is now open source and we really appreciate the community jumping in and helping us continue to build and shape the future of xSafe!
